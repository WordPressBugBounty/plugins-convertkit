## Email Subscription Forms and Newsletter Forms

Design [forms](https://kit.com/features/forms?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in Kit, choosing from a variety of designs, customisable to your branding for your email newsletter strategy.

Email newsletter sign up forms can be configured to:

- Send free content, such as a PDF newsletter
- Display when the user is about to leave the page
- Subscribe to an email newsletter, with powerful tagging and segmentation options for your newsletter subscribers

Embedding Kit email subscription forms on your WordPress web site with the Kit Plugin is quick and simple:

- Choose a default form to be displayed below each individual Post Type (Pages, Posts and other public Post Types, such as WooCommerce Products) to grow your email subscribers
- Choose a specific email marketing form to be displayed below a specific Page, Post or custom post type
- Turn off form embedding at both site wide and/or individual Page/Post level to control your email newsletter strategy

For greater control, Kit's email marketing subscription forms can be displayed in specific sections of your WordPress site's content, sidebars and footers by:

- Using the Kit Forms block in Gutenberg
- Using the `[convertkit]` shortcode in the Classic Editor
- Using the Form Builder block in Gutenberg, to build fully custom subscription forms directly in WordPress - perfect for following your theme's styles

Start collecting email subscribers today, building your newsletter audience and taking your email marketing to the next level.

## Form Builder Block

Kit's Form Builder block, for the WordPress block editor, gives complete control to design and customize your own subscription and email marketing forms - directly in WordPress.

With the Form Builder block, you can:

- Add fields such as first name, email address, and custom fields
- Apply tags and sequences to subscribers for powerful segmentation
- Enable reCAPTCHA protection (if configured in your Kit account)
- Style forms using block editor controls, with full support for your block theme’s CSS and styling

This makes the Form Builder block ideal for:

- Subscription forms to grow your email subscribers list
- Contact forms that connect directly to Kit
- Custom forms tailored to your email marketing strategy

Build forms exactly how you want them, without touching a line of code, and start collecting the right email subscribers from day one.

## Membership Sites and Membership Content Protection

Create powerful membership sites with Kit's Membership Content feature. Require email subscribers to either purchase a [Kit Product](https://kit.com/features/commerce), or subscribe for free, to access your membership content - whether that's a course, ebook, digital download, album, presets, coaching and more. 

This membership functionality transforms your WordPress site into a comprehensive membership platform. Subscribers access their membership by entering their email address, receiving a one time passcode by email and clicking the link in the email. That's it - no complex membership plugins or payment gateways to configure for your membership site.

There's no limit to the number of Kit Products you can create for your membership site, and each can be assigned to one or more WordPress Pages and Posts, instantly turning them into membership-only content for your paid subscribers. Build a thriving membership community with ease.

Whether you're creating a paid membership site, or offering free membership access, Kit's membership features provide the flexibility to monetize your content through membership subscriptions while growing your email subscribers list simultaneously.

## Send Email Newsletters and Email Marketing Campaigns

Use Kit's [email marketing](https://kit.com/features/email-marketing?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) feature to build and send email newsletters to your subscribers and leads, with options to send email newsletters to segments of your newsletter subscriber list.

Embed existing email newsletters on your WordPress web site, ensuring visitors never miss your email newsletter content, by:

- Using the Kit Broadcasts block in Gutenberg
- Using the `[convertkit_broadcasts]` shortcode in the Classic Editor

## Landing Pages for Email Newsletter Growth

Design [landing pages](https://kit.com/features/landing-pages?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in Kit's intuitive editor, choosing from a variety of landing page designs, customisable to your branding and ideal for building your email subscribers list or selling a product.

Additional landing pages can then be embedded on your WordPress web site. Simply create or edit a WordPress Page, choose the Kit landing page from the Kit meta box settings to display, and you're all set to begin growing your email subscribers list more effectively with targeted landing pages.

## Sell Products and Membership Access

Embed buttons (or link text) to sell your Kit Products and Tip Jars in seconds - whether that's digital goods, paid email newsletters, membership access, membership-only content, music, coaching and more. Perfect for membership sites and monetization.

## List Email Newsletters

Continue your email marketing strategy by automatically publishing your past email newsletters to WordPress Posts, defining a WordPress author, category and cut-off date within the Plugin's settings to keep your newsletter subscribers informed.

Prefer to just list existing broadcasts, each linked to your Kit profile? Use the Broadcasts block or shortcode to embed your existing newsletters in any WordPress Page, Post or Custom Post Type, providing more touchpoints for your email newsletter content.

Yes! Design professional landing pages in Kit's landing page editor, then display them on any WordPress page. Landing pages are optimized specifically for email newsletter signups and subscriber conversion. Choose from pre-built landing page templates or customize your own. The plugin seamlessly integrates Kit landing pages into WordPress for consistent subscriber experience.

= How does the membership site feature work? =

The membership feature lets you restrict WordPress content to paying email subscribers or newsletter members. Create Products in Kit, then assign them to specific WordPress pages or posts. When email subscribers visit protected content, they're prompted to enter their email. If they've purchased the required Kit Product, they receive membership access via a magic link. No complex membership plugins needed.

= Can I segment my email subscribers for targeted newsletters? =

Absolutely! Kit provides powerful subscriber segmentation using tags. Automatically tag email subscribers based on which newsletter form they used, which links they clicked, or which Kit Products they purchased. Send targeted email newsletters to specific subscriber segments for more relevant email marketing campaigns and higher newsletter engagement rates.

= Do I need coding knowledge to use this plugin? =

No coding required! Create newsletter subscription forms, landing pages, and email campaigns using Kit's visual editors. Embed newsletter forms using native WordPress blocks or simple shortcodes. Build membership sites by selecting Products from dropdowns. Even custom newsletter forms in WordPress can be built using the drag-and-drop block editor without touching code.

= How do I refresh available forms, landing pages, and tags? =

Click the refresh button next to Form, Landing Page, or Tag dropdowns when editing Pages or Posts. This syncs your latest newsletter forms and products from Kit to WordPress. You can also refresh all resources at once by navigating to Settings > Kit and clicking refresh. This ensures your newest email subscriber capture forms are always available.

= Can I automatically import email newsletters to WordPress? =

Yes! Navigate to Settings > Kit > Broadcasts and enable automatic import. Your published email newsletters from Kit will automatically import as WordPress posts. Configure the import schedule, post author, category, and featured image settings. This keeps newsletter subscribers engaged by making your email content discoverable on your site.

= What integrations work with email subscriber capture? =

The plugin integrates with Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, WooCommerce, WishList Member, Elementor, and more. Automatically add form submissions as email subscribers, tag WooCommerce customers for email marketing, sync membership levels with newsletter subscriber tags, and use native Elementor widgets for newsletter forms. Additional integrations available through separate plugins.

= How do I display newsletter forms in specific locations? =

You have multiple options for newsletter form placement. Set site-wide defaults that display newsletter signup forms automatically below posts and pages. Override defaults on individual posts to show specific email subscriber forms. Use blocks or shortcodes to embed newsletter forms within content at optimal conversion points. Add widget newsletter forms to sidebars and footers.

= Can I create free membership content for newsletter subscribers? =

Yes! You can gate content requiring only email subscription without requiring payment. This is perfect for exclusive newsletter subscriber content, free member communities, or content upgrades. Use Tag-based restrictions where entering an email and receiving membership access via magic link is all that's required. Great for building email subscriber loyalty.

= Does this work with my WordPress theme? =

The plugin works with any WordPress theme. Newsletter signup forms and landing pages are designed to adapt to your theme's styling. The Form Builder block uses your theme's CSS ensuring newsletter forms match your site perfectly. Inline forms blend seamlessly into content while modal, slide-in, and sticky bar newsletter forms maintain Kit's polished design.

= How do I track email subscriber growth and conversions? =

Track subscriber growth, newsletter form conversion rates, email campaign performance, and landing page analytics directly in your Kit dashboard. Monitor which newsletter forms convert best, which landing pages drive the most email subscribers, and which email newsletters get the highest engagement from your subscriber list. All metrics update in real-time.

= What's the difference between inline and non-inline newsletter forms? =

Inline newsletter forms embed directly within page content and scroll with the page. They're great for email subscriber capture within blog posts. Non-inline forms include modals (popups), slide-ins (appear from corners), and sticky bars (fixed to top/bottom). Non-inline newsletter forms demand attention and often achieve higher email subscriber conversion rates.

= Can I customize newsletter form colors and styling? =

Yes! Customize newsletter subscription forms in Kit's form editor matching your brand colors, fonts, and style. Adjust form button colors, input field styling, and background colors. For inline forms, the Form Builder block in WordPress uses your theme's styling automatically, ensuring newsletter forms blend seamlessly with your site design.

= What happens when someone subscribes to my newsletter? =

When visitors submit newsletter signup forms, they're added as email subscribers to your Kit account. You can configure forms to immediately add subscribers to your newsletter list, tag them for segmentation, or enroll them in automated email sequences. Subscribers receive welcome emails if configured, and you can start sending email newsletters immediately.

= How do membership magic links work for subscribers? =

When an email subscriber tries accessing protected membership content, they enter their email address. If they've purchased the required Kit Product or have the necessary tag, they receive an email containing a one-time code and magic link. Clicking the magic link or entering the code grants immediate membership access without requiring passwords.

= Can I sell digital products through membership features? =

Yes! Create Products in Kit and sell them directly to your email subscribers. Products can be one-time purchases, subscriptions, or tip jars. Assign Products to WordPress pages and posts as membership content. When newsletter subscribers purchase Products, they automatically get membership access to all associated content in WordPress.

= Do newsletter forms slow down my site? =

No. Newsletter subscription forms load asynchronously and are optimized for performance. The plugin only loads necessary assets on pages actually displaying newsletter forms. Landing pages are hosted on Kit's servers ensuring fast load times. The lightweight codebase ensures email subscriber capture doesn't impact your WordPress site speed.

= How many newsletter forms can I create? =

There's no limit to the number of newsletter subscription forms you can create in Kit. Design different forms for different audiences, pages, or lead magnets. Create targeted newsletter signup forms for each email subscriber segment. Test variations of forms to optimize conversion. All forms sync automatically with the WordPress plugin.

Set up recurring newsletters that send automatically on a schedule. Ensure global email subscribers receive newsletters at appropriate times for their timezone.

= What's the difference between tags and segments for email subscribers? =

Tags are labels you apply to newsletter subscribers based on interests, behavior, or characteristics. Segments are filtered views of your subscriber list based on one or more tags. Use tags to organize email subscribers, then create segments to send targeted newsletters. For example, tag subscribers as "interested in courses" then create a segment for course email marketing.

= Can I migrate existing email subscribers to Kit? =

Yes! Kit provides easy import tools for migrating email subscribers from other platforms. Import CSV files containing subscriber data. The plugin maintains subscriber tags and preferences during migration. You can continue sending newsletters immediately after importing.

You can also manually remove subscribers from Settings > Kit in WordPress or directly in your Kit account. Unsubscribed email addresses are automatically excluded from future newsletter sends.

Tag purchasers for targeted email marketing campaigns. Track purchase data for each newsletter subscriber. Send abandoned cart emails to recover lost sales. Build email subscriber value over time.

= Can I create multiple membership tiers for subscribers? =

Yes! Create different Kit Products for each membership tier. Assign Products to different WordPress content. Newsletter subscribers purchase the membership tier they want and automatically get access to corresponding content. Create Bronze, Silver, Gold membership tiers each with different Products and content access for paying email subscribers.

= How do landing pages improve email subscriber conversions? =

Landing pages are specifically designed for single conversion goals like email newsletter signups. They remove navigation and distractions, focusing visitors entirely on becoming email subscribers. Use compelling headlines, clear value propositions, social proof, and strong calls-to-action. Kit's landing page templates are proven to convert visitors into newsletter subscribers at high rates.

= What email marketing automations can I create for subscribers? =

Create welcome sequences greeting new email subscribers with your best content. Build product launch funnels promoting offers to newsletter segments. Set up abandoned cart sequences for WooCommerce email marketing. Create re-engagement campaigns for inactive newsletter subscribers. Configure behavioral automations tagging email subscribers based on email clicks and website activity.

= Can I embed past email newsletters on my WordPress site? =

Yes! Use the Broadcasts block or `[convertkit_broadcasts]` shortcode to display past email newsletters on any page or post. This keeps newsletter content discoverable for website visitors, drives email subscriber signups from engaged readers, and extends the life of newsletter content beyond inboxes.

= How do I optimize newsletter forms for mobile email subscribers? =

All newsletter subscription forms and landing pages are automatically mobile-responsive. Forms resize and reorganize for small screens ensuring easy email subscriber signup on phones and tablets. Test newsletter forms on mobile devices to verify the email subscriber experience. The Form Builder block uses responsive WordPress patterns for perfect mobile newsletter conversion.

Use multiple newsletter form types strategically. Place inline newsletter forms within valuable blog posts where visitors are most engaged.

Design a dedicated landing page promoting the lead magnet optimized for newsletter signups. Create a newsletter subscription form offering the lead magnet in exchange for email addresses. Set up an automated email sequence delivering the lead magnet and nurturing new newsletter subscribers.

= What is the Form Builder block for email newsletter forms? =

The Form Builder block is a native WordPress block that lets you create custom email newsletter subscription forms directly in the WordPress editor without any coding.

= How does the Form Builder block differ from regular newsletter forms? =

Regular newsletter forms are designed in Kit and embedded in WordPress. The Form Builder block lets you build email subscription forms entirely within WordPress using the block editor.

Form Builder newsletter forms have full integration with Kit's email subscriber management features.

= How do I add a Form Builder newsletter form to my WordPress site? =

In the WordPress block editor, click the plus icon to add a new block and search for "Kit Form Builder." Add the block to your page or post. Configure your email newsletter form by adding fields like email and first name. Customize the styling, colors, and spacing to match your theme. Optionally assign tags or sequences for email subscriber segmentation. Publish to start capturing email subscribers with your custom newsletter form.

= Can Form Builder newsletter forms collect custom subscriber data? =

Yes! The Form Builder block supports custom fields you've created in your Kit account. Add custom fields to collect specific information from email newsletter subscribers like job titles, company names, interests, or any data relevant to your email marketing strategy.

= Can I use the Form Builder block for contact forms and email subscribers? =

This makes Form Builder perfect for dual-purpose forms capturing both contacts and newsletter subscribers.

= Does the Form Builder block support spam protection for newsletter signups? =

Yes! The Form Builder block integrates with Google reCAPTCHA v3 if configured in your Kit account at Settings > Kit > General.

The block provides intuitive controls in the WordPress editor sidebar letting you style email newsletter forms visually without touching code while maintaining theme consistency.

= Can I view Form Builder newsletter form submissions in WordPress? =

Yes! Navigate to Settings > Kit > Form Entries to view all submissions from Form Builder newsletter forms.
